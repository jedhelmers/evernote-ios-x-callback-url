# Evernote iOS x-callback-url support

Evernote iOS app started supporting x-callback-url from version 7.5. Some apps are already using this integration, like [Launch Center Pro](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/launch-center-pro/id532016360?mt=8) and [Drafts 4](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/drafts-4-quickly-capture-notes/id905337691?mt=8).  
Here's an example in [Launch Center Pro](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/launch-center-pro/id532016360?mt=8)

[Phillip Gruneich](https://twitter.com/pgruneich) wrote a great [article](https://onetapless.com/exploring-evernote-xcallbackurl) about x-callback-url support in Evernote iOS and wonderful things we can accomplish with this. I recommend you read it [here](https://onetapless.com/exploring-evernote-xcallbackurl).  
This repo serves as the documentation. Feel free to file a bug or a feature request on this Github repo.

## Overview

Extensions in iOS 8 and OS X Yosemite makes integrations between apps easier than ever. But according to WWDC 2014, URL schemes is still the recommended way to do inter-app communication. [x-callback-url](http://x-callback-url.com/) is a popular solution in the iOS community and there're [a lot of apps](http://x-callback-url.com/apps/) that's adopting it.

## Scheme

Following the [specs](http://x-callback-url.com/specifications/), the x-callback scheme in Evernote iOS is
```
evernote://x-callback-url/[action]?[action parameters]&[x-callback parameters]
```
You can integrate with Evernote iOS app with literally one line of Objective-C code, for example:
```objective-c
[[UIApplication sharedApplication] openURL:[NSURL URLWithString:@"evernote://x-callback-url/new-note?type=text&title=EC%204&text=this%20is%20a%20great%20day"]];
```
Or Swift, if you like
```swift
UIApplication.sharedApplication().openURL(NSURL(string: "evernote://x-callback-url/new-note?type=text&title=EC%204&text=this%20is%20a%20great%20day"))
```

**Note: the parameters are URL encoded**

## x-callback parameters
_**This is optional but recommended for better user experience**_

x-callback-url defines several parameters with specific purposes, all of which are optional. These parameters should be passed as query args in the URL, in the format ```key1=value1&key2=value2```. All values should be URL encoded strings. You should use these parameters to provide callback URLs of your app, and handle success/cancel/error completion cases in the app delegate.

* **x-success** : URL to open on completion of saving a note. If not provided, the user will stay in the Evernote app after the action is successfully completed.

* **x-cancel** : URL to open if the requested action is cancelled by the user. If not provided, the user will stay in the Evernote app after the action is cancelled.

* **x-error** : URL to open if the requested action generates an error or failed to complete. In such case, Evernote app will report the failure to the user, log the error in App Log (On Evernote iOS, Settings->Support->Activity Log) and return to the source app. If not present, user will stay in the Evernote app.
